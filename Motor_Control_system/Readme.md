The plant here is a 3-phase induction motor. The efficient control of a 3-phase induction motor
is accomplished using a modern control technique known as Field Oriented Control (FOC), also
known as Vector Control.

Objective:
The aim of this project is to understand the dynamics of the system, following which we will
develop a controller for both flux and speed of the motor using multiple PI controllers. The
first task in this work would be to linearise and model the system. The second task would be
to analyse the system response and see if the approximations made in the small signal model
are accurate. Following this, we will develop 2 PI controllers to simultaneously control both
flux and speed.
