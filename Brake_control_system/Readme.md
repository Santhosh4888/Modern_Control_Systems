The plant considered here is the pneumatic subsystem of a heavy vehicle brake system. The
air pressure in the system is controlled via an Electro-Pneumatic Regulator (EPR). The input
to the plant is the voltage input to the EPR, and the output is the pressure inside the brake
system.

Objective: The aim of this project is to improve the performance of the brake system using classical
control methods. The first task in this work would be to model the brake system, i.e., to find
the plant transfer function. The second task would be to design a P and a PI controller using
root locus, to meet the given performance specifications. Two ways to deal with time delay
will be explored: one using Padeâ€™s Approximation and the second using Smith Predictor.
